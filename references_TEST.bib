              of consensus about issues and products and a number of studies
              have focused on the design, evaluation, and utilization of online
              opinion systems. However, little effort has been spent on the
              dynamic aspects of online opinion formation. In this article, we
              study the dynamics of online opinion expression by analyzing the
              temporal evolution of vey large sets of user views and determine
              that in the course of time, later opinions tend to show a big
              difference with earlier opinions, which moderates the average
              opinion to the less extreme. Online posters also tend to disagree
              with previous opinions when the cost of expression is high.",

  abstract = "Vibrant online communities are in constant flux. As members join
              and depart, the interactional norms evolve, stimulating fur- ther
              changes to the membership and its social dynamics. Linguistic
              change--in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the
              norm--is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates
              indi- vidual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective
              identity. We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as
              it hap- pens and for understanding how specific users react to
              these evolv- ing norms. By applying this framework to two large
              online commu- nities we show that users follow a determined
              two-stage lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to
              linguistic change: a linguisti- cally innovative learning phase in
              which users adopt the language of the community followed by a
              conservative phase in which users stop changing and the evolving
              community norms pass them by. Building on this observation, we
              show how this framework can be used to detect, early in a user's
              career, how long she will stay active in the community. Thus, this
              work has practical signifi- cance for those who design and
              maintain online communities. It also yields new theoretical
              insights into the evolution of linguis- tic norms and the complex
              interplay between community-level and individual-level linguistic
              change.",

  abstract = "The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of
              amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with
              word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as
              vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural
              language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings
              trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender
              stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because
              their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these
              biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured
              by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words
              are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in
              the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a
              methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender
              stereotypes, such as the association between between the words
              receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations
              such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to
              quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and
              develop algorithms to ``debias'' the embedding. Using crowd-worker
              evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically
              demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias
              in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as
              the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy
              tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications
              without amplifying gender bias.",
